# hidKeyboard
A generic script to make an arduino or attiny85 development board simulate a keyboard. Usefull for red teaming, penetration testing and... other activities.

Write your payload, compile it to your device, connect that device to the target's computer and then sit back and watch your script being executed Mr Robot style.

Take care: If you are using an Arduino, as soon as the code compiles to the device successfully, the payload WILL IMMEDIATELY RUN at your computer. Be ready to pull that thing off.

Might add a version for Raspberry Pi Pico later on, it works simillarly to the Arduino though.
